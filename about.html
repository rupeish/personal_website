      	<p>Hi, I'm Rupesh, a Instrumentation and Control Engineering student from <strong>Vishwakarma Institute of Technology</strong>, Pune. When I'm not in the classroom, you'll usually find me coding or playing video games or talking excitedly to people about the most random things. I am a dynamic figure, often found suffering from excessive enthusiasm. I am in my junior year in college and I expect to graduate in June 2021.</p>
      	<p>I love programming. I mostly write C/C++ and I love to play around with other web technologies. I care about <strong>designing user friendly interfaces</strong> and other aspects of front end web development. I am always looking to solve interesting problems with code. </p>
      	<p>I also enjoy playing football, and reading on Business and Management, indian philosophy.
